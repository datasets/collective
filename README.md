# DataHub Collective

We are a collective who care about creating high-quality open data. We curate, publish, and maintain datasets together, and build the tooling to support that. We also just hangout and [chat about data stuff](https://discord.gg/8KvAeFV).

More specifically, we steward the **[[ideas/DataHub Commons|DataHub Commons]]** and work together on developing the tooling and platform to run it.

*A collective for open data, by open data folks.*

## Initiatives

- Data Collective [notes, posts, and ideas](https://datahub.io/notes).
- [Newsletter](https://thedatacollective.substack.com/).
- Fireside Chats.
- Community Building (coworking sessions, connection calls, brainstorms).

## Vision

A collaborative initiative focused on democratizing data and empowering communities through open data solutions. The key aspects are:

- **The Collective**: Building a cooperative-like organization for data infrastructure and curation, inspired by the Mondragon Corporation model.
- **Community Empowerment**: Providing open data to help local communities make informed decisions.
- **Open Data Framework(s)**: Developing protocols and tools to improve the production, sharing, consumption, and collaboration on open datasets.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Curating and creating data-informed analyses, similar to "Our World in Data" but with a more inclusive, collaborative approach.
- **Cooperative Data Agency**: Establishing a sustainable, values-driven enterprise that offers data services with a focus on cooperation and democratization.
- **Innovative Monetization**: Exploring new incentive structures and monetization strategies for data across communities.
- **Long-Term Vision**: Creating a "data treasurehouse" that preserves and curates valuable information over time.
- **Values and Culture**: Embodying core values of cooperation, democratization, and transparency throughout the project's work and organizational structure.

The ultimate goal is to create a **more democratic, egalitarian, and innovative approach to data** that could potentially replace or complement existing data giants like Google or Bloomberg.

In all of these, our intuition has converged on fact that to create something impactful means quality and sustainability which means income which means an enterprise.
