The **DataHub Collective** is a home for people who care about maintaining, publishing, and curating high-quality open datasets â€” and for those developing and discussing the tools that make this possible.

More specifically, it's a community of people maintaining the **DataHub Commons** of shared datasets, publishing material on **DataHub.io**, and contributing to the open-source tooling around it.

You can think of it as an open, collective, DataHub-oriented version of *Our World in Data*: a collaborative ecosystem for open data publishing and infrastructure.
